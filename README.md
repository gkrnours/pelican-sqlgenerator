Pelican SQLGenerator
===================
## Feed your pelican with a database

### Why?

Plain text file are really nice for hacker. We work on them with our
beloved text editor. It's where we spend most of our time.

But what happen when they are met by people who are not used to write
code? They need to handle all these little file, with close to no
benefit. And task that should be easy like counting file, searching all
that are older than a week or match a particular tag ?

Plain text file are really nice. I love them. But a lot of usage benefit
from another approach. That's why this project exist.
